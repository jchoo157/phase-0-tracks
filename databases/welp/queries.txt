1. In the welp directory, create a file called queries.txt. Once you've figured out the queries below, paste them into queries.txt, along with the output from your database.

DONE

2. You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

sqlite> SELECT businesses.name, users.first_name, users.last_name, reviews.comment, reviews.stars FROM reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesse
Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|Bradford|Pitt|great food!|5
Amir's Towing|Holly|Berry|rude employees!|1
Lotus Yoga|Angela|Jolie|great place!|4

3. There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

sqlite> SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM users LEFT JOIN reviews ON users.id = reviews.user_id LEFT JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id;

4. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?

sqlite> SELECT * FROM businesses LEFT JOIN reviews ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id LEFT JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id WHERE businesses.id = 3;
