* What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?

A GET request is when you are requesting data from a specified resource.  A POST request is when you are submitting data to be processed from a specified resource.  A GET request might be used when you type in a website in the url.  A POST request might be used when you are editing, deleting, creating an account on a website.

* Optional bonus question: What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?

A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent from a website and stored to a users web browser while the user is browsing.  It relates to HTTP requests because the websites you visit using GET requests can contain cookies that will then be stored in your web browser.
