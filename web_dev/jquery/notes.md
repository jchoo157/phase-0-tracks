In order to learn as much as I can on jQuery, I will probably start off with a video tutorial on youtube that will give me a quick rundown on things I can do.  From there, I can research techniques that interest me further and try it out.  I think it's important to test what I learn whenever I can.  Breaks are important because I don't want to over stress myself if things get too much for me at the moment.  Simple 5 minute breaks can help ease my mind so I can jump right back into it feeling better.  

Watching videos turned out to be the most effective.  I am a very visual learner and seeing how it's done step by step and having it explained outloud seems to always work for me.  I can try out anything shown in the videos myself and change up little things to see if it works.
