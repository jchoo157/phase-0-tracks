# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

  Version control is a system that keeps track of versions of a software overtime.  It's useful because if a mistake is made or you lose all your files on your local computer, you can retrieve it thanks to version control.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

  The default branch in Git is named master.  You would use branches to create clones of master and make changes safely and once it's ready, they can be merged into master.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

  A commit is a save point in Git.  A good commit message will explain what changes were made.

* What is a merge conflict?

  A merge conflict is when two branches made the same changes in the same file.  You have to fix it before they can merge.
